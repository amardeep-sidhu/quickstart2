<p><a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/">Tom Kyte</a> did <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2007/10/new-policy-of-sorts.html">a post</a> on <a href="http://tkyte.blogspot.com/">his blog</a> about posting of reviews of questions on <a href="http://asktom.oracle.com/">Asktom</a>. In a nutshell the reviews not related to the original question will be ignored/deleted (not decided yet, as Tom said).</p>
<p>As other people said in the comments, personally I too like this idea very much. Earlier, many times, there were questions which started with someone asking about appropriate SGA size, then there were some other twists and discussions and then the thread ended in discussion about good or bad authors or something similar light years away from the original topic.</p>
<p>Now this action will make the discussions flow in a very controlled and neat &amp; clean manner, all about the original topic. Hoping to see all the ‚Äúgreat content‚Äù in a very orderly manner üôÇ</p>
