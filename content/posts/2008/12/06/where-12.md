A small post to let everybody know that I am alive ðŸ˜‰ .

Few weeks back, in office we were looking at one procedure which was supposed to do a lot but if executed it finished in a sec (or less ðŸ˜‰ ). I started looking into it and just opened the procedure and started scrolling to find that the last line of the very first cursor read:

**where 1=2;**

Wonderful !
