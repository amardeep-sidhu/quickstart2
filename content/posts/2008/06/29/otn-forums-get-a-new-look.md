Just had a glimpse. OTN forums has got a new look. A bunch of new features has also been added. Some of the new things i noticed are:

- That simple editor is now rich text editor. Also supports emoticons.
- You can add tags to a post and it displays the tag cloud (for all the posts) on right side.
- A post can be marked as a question and then there will be some points system based on answers.
- That list of Top users doesn‚Äôt show those users n ACEs. It display a new list of people instead.
- Report Abuse button has been added (with each reply).

May be there are some other changes too. That is what i noticed in the very first look.

Nice change indeed ! I am not happy with the font though, it is very small üôÅ
