<p>Yesterday I was configuring EM 12c for a Sun Super Cluster system. There were a total of 4 LDOMs where I needed to deploy the agent (Setup –&gt; Add targets –&gt; Add targets manually). Out of these 4 everything went fine for 2 LDOMs but for the other two it failed with an error message. It didn’t give much details on the EM screen but rather gave a message to try to secure/start the agent manually. When I tried to do that manually the secure agent part worked fine but the start agent command failed with the following error message:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->oracle@app1:~$emctl start agent<br>

Starting agent ………………………………………………………. failed.<br>

Possible port conflict on port(3872): Retrying the operation…<br>
Failed to start the agent after 1 attempts. Please check that the port(3872) is available.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I thought that there was something wrong with the port thing so I cleaned the agent installation, made sure that the port wasn’t being used and did the agent deployment again. This time it again failed with the same message but it reported a different port number ie 1830 agent port no:</p>

<p>Again checked few things but found nothing wrong. All the LDOMs had similar configuration so what worked for the other two should have worked for these two also.</p>
<p>Before starting with the installation I had noted the LDOM hostnames and IPs in a notepad file and had swapped the IPs of two LDOMs (actually these two only <img src="http://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout.png" alt="Smile with tongue out"> ). But later on I found that and corrected. While looking at the notepad file it occurred to me that the same stuff could be wrong in /etc/hosts of the server where EM is deployed. Oh boy that is what it was. While making the entries in /etc/hosts of EM server, I copied it from the notepad and the wrong entries got copied. The IPs for these two LDOMs got swapped with each other and that was causing the whole problem.</p>
<p>deinstalled the agent, correct the /etc/hosts and tried to deploy again…all worked well !</p>
