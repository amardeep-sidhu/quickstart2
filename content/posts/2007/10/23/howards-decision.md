[Howard Rogers](http://www.dizwell.com/) has done [a post](http://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/1058) on his [blog](http://www.dizwell.com/prod/blog) that is the site [Dizwell](http://www.dizwell.com/) worth it ? Do post your opinion. If he plans to close it down, we will miss a great resource for Oracle.
