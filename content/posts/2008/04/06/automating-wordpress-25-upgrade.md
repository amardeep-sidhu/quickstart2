I recently [upgraded](http://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/30/upgrading-to-wordpress-25/) my blog to WordPress 2.5. The manual process is real cumbersome. Today I came across few plugins which help in almost automating the upgrade stuff.

[WordPress Automatic upgrade:](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-automatic-upgrade/) As per description this plugin first takes backup and then upgrades. I didn’t try this one, though.

[Instant Upgrade:](http://www.zirona.com/software/wordpress-instant-upgrade/) I upgraded one of my blog using this. It doesn’t take care of backup but otherwise the upgrade was super smooth. Just few clicks and you are done.

Happy upgrading !
