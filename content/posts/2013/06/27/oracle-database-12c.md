So there is a new toy in the market for database geeks : Oracle has released database 12c. Every social platform is abuzz with the 12c activity. So thought that I should also complete the ritual ![Winking smile](http://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png)

In [this post](http://blog.aristadba.com/?p=254) Aman has already summed up many important links.

Maria Colgan has posted some useful links [here](https://blogs.oracle.com/optimizer/entry/oracle_database_12c_is_here).

And [here is a link](http://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=202202:2:::::P2_SUCHWORT:migrate12c) to a slidedeck about Upgrading and Migrating to 12c.

Happy 12câ€™ing !
