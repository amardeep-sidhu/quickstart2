Last week i had a chance to conduct my lifeâ€™s first interview. The guy was a DBA with 2 years of experience and it was supposed to be a telephonic call. I checked out his CV and wrote down around 8 questions on a paper, just to make sure that i myself donâ€™t get confused during the interview ðŸ˜‰ . So i called him in the evening and started with introduction and his present job profile. Then i started with the questions from the projects he had done. He was confident about the stuff he was handling and replied all the questions honestly, saying NO at points where he didnâ€™t know or was not involved in something. One of such thing was testing the backups. He said there is no testing done as such.

In his CV he had written about Data Guard also. So i asked few data guard questions like what is the difference in working of physical and logical standby ? He was not aware about some of the data types not being supported in logical standby.

Overall he answered the questions pretty confidently and honestly. So at the end, i recommended his induction into the company ðŸ™‚

Happy Ending !

BTW from the first experience i can say that it feels good to be on the other side of table (or phone).
