<span style="font-family:verdana;">I was checking [Tom Kyte’s blog](http://tkyte.blogspot.com/). It was about an [article](http://nomadishere.com/2007/03/12/a-note-to-employers-8-things-intelligent-people-geeks-and-nerds-need-to-work-happy) titled A Note To Employers: 8 Things Intelligent People, Geeks and Nerds Need To Work Happily. Well first of all meaning of all three words from “define: \* in Google”</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;"> 1. Intelligent: having the capacity for thought and reason especially to a high degree</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;"> 2. Geek: In computers and the Internet, a geekis a person who is inordinately dedicated to and involved with the technologyto the point of sometimes not appearing to be like the rest of us (non-geeks).Being a geek also implies a capability with the technology.</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;"> 3. Nerd: A computer expert by aptitude and not mere training. Usually male, under the age of 35 and socially inept; a person whose tremendous skill with operating or designing computer hardware or software is exceeded only by his, rarely her, passionate love of the technology.</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;">So all the three words refer to some exceptional class of people, not everybody 😉 Here are my views about all the points:</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;"> 1. Yes flexible timings is a big thing. Different classes of people are there. One that can work in morning, another late night so and so and one that can’t anytime (but this article is not for those 😉</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;"> 2. Yes everybody likes different kind of environment around. I like greenry and natural things, if possible 🙂 &amp; the nap thing i strongly agree to 😉</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;"> 3. Except while sleeping and listening to some classical genre of music, I need light 🙂</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;"> 4. Nice idea. &amp; I ALMOST HATE those people talking on the phone everytime, specially sales people &amp; managers.</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;"> 5. Yes. No suits and formals. It is upto you whatever you like. Reid &amp; Taylor Suits are ok for James Bond in 007 series but are not going to help in bringing up a server from crash or catching an exception that has propagated to 5th-6th calling program because somebody didn’t handle it at proper place earlier 🙂</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;"> 6. Not a big issue. Just need the company of like minded people and it is fine 🙂</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;"> 7. Yes. No meetings just for the sake of meetings. We need work not meetings.</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;"> 8. It hurts the soul.</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;">So those are all my views about this. Do post what you think ?</span>

<span style="font-family:verdana;">Cheers !</span>
