Last week I attended a training on AIX system administration from IBM (organized by company, obviously ðŸ˜‰ It was a 7 days course covering all of the system administration stuff. There was a lot of new stuff to learn, <span style="font-weight: bold">LVM</span> being the most number of times uttered word, once we did the chapter on LVM. It was a nice experience as a whole as for the first time I attended any training on Unix.

The sessions (specially after lunch) were sleepy also. I find this ppt method of training pretty boring. The trainer (most of) strictly, stupidly follows the slides and slide, I feel is a dumb sort of thing, makes you feel sleepy except at the moments when there are few eye opening bullet points.

There should be bare minimum number of slides and for rest of the things, trainer should use white board so that everybody follows that and doesnâ€™t sleep ðŸ™‚

Anyways it was really enjoying to be familiar with so many things in Unix.
