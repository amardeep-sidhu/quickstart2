Few months ago I contributed a chapter (on Monitoring, Troubleshooting and Performance tuning) to a GoldenGate book on Oracle Press that [Robert Freeman](http://robertgfreeman.blogspot.in/) was authoring. Thought of posting a small update that the book is now out. My name doesnâ€™t appear on the main page ![Sad smile](http://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png) but you will see it in the Acknowledgements section ![Winking smile](http://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png) Below is a screenshot taken from Amazon preview ![Smile](http://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wlEmoticon-smile.png).

You may want to grab a copy if you are using/planning to use Oracle GoldenGate 11g.

Here is the [link](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071790888/ref=s9_psimh_gw_p14_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0DT9DTV6S8VKQ6B502FN&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1389517282&pf_rd_i=507846) to the book page on Amazon. It seems the book is not published in India yet but one can order the imported edition on [amazon.in](http://www.amazon.in/Oracle-GoldenGate-Handbook-Robert-Freeman/dp/0071790888/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1374159073&sr=8-1&keywords=goldengate)
