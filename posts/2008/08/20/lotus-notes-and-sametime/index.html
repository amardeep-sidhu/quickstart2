<p>My company uses Lotus Notes for email and Sametime connect as messenger for all the internal communication. Both are stupid applications and are a big resource hogs. Most of the systems are P IV with 512 MB RAM. You just run Lotus and Sametime 7 and it eats up everything. The system moves like a 386 based machine.</p>
<p>Moreover, i was looking for Lotus short cuts today and found that there is no short cut in Lotus for <strong>Send/Receive</strong> mail.</p>
<p>At our clientâ€™s site, i have seen IBM people having kept an exe killnotes.exe on their desktop which they use to quickly exit from Lotus. What bullshit ?</p>
<p>Outlook/Outlook Express rocks, seriously !</p>
