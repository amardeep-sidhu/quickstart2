<span style="font-family:verdana;">When I got my Laptop, along with it also got Norton Internet Security and 2 months subscription for updates &amp; all. Whenever I would boot up the laptop Internet Security would open the window for configuration. I kept on cancelling it for 2 weeks or so. But one fine (read not fine 🙁 day I configured it. It was very happy. Said **Thank You** at the end. But the best was yet to come. After 10-15 days Windows (XP media center is installed on my Laptop) started showing signs of strain 😉 It won’t start properly, after saying loading your settings it will stuck. Then I had to kill explorer.exe and start it again. With this also one strange problem that no startup items will be loaded 🙁 I was discussing the same with one of my friend. He said that Norton must be the culprit. So I thought about uninstalling it. When I tried to uninstall it gave some strange error. Anyways it also told about one URL from where one could check details of the error. Finally when the uninstall started it gave one beautiful message “You still have 39 days of subscription left, if you uninstall the product you will not be able to reuse the subscription” 😀</span>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">After uninstalling when I rebooted, Windows was perfectly fine. Then I enabled windows firewall and installed AVG Free Antivirus (One of my favorite when it comes to using resources and loading at startup). Everything in place now 🙂</span><span style="font-family:verdana;">Cheers !</span>
