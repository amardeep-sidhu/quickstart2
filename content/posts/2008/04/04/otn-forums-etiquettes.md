Finally finally finally a [small sticky](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/ann.jspa?annID=718) has been posted on OTN Database forums homepage. But its there only on Database forums page not on PL/SQL. It reads like:

 *Posters, please mind these common-sense rules when participating here:*

*â€“ When asking a question, provide all the details that someone would need to answer it. Consulting documentation first is highly recommended. (See <http://blogs.oracle.com/shay/2007/03/02> for more hints.)  
â€“ When answering a question, please be courteous; there are different levels of experience represented here. A poorly worded question is better ignored than flamed â€“ or better yet, help the poster ask a better question.*

*Thanks for doing your part to make this community as valuable as possible for everyone!*

*â€“ OTN*

That means Database forum enjoys most number of flames ðŸ˜‰
