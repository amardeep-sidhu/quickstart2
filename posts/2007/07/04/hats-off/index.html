<p>Since I switched to this new job, my profile has changed. Here I work as a DBA. So my interaction with Oracle &amp; anything related to Oracle has also increased. Started exploring Oracle related forums and websites specially OTN forums (<a href="http://forums.oracle.com">http://forums.oracle.com</a>) This is the only page thats almost always open on my Desktop in office &amp; Laptop at home and I refresh more than my office Lotus Notes. Today I was reading <a href="http://radiofreetooting.blogspot.com/2007/07/where-does-he-find-time.html">APCs blog</a> , that Jonathan Lewis has also started posting on OTN forums and being so busy man, from where he finds the time ? I too think the same. There are so many people having many years of experience in industry, answering the questions on OTN, uesnet groups and various other forums and everything is for free. They are not paid anything for the same thing. Its like taking time out of your time, understand somebody’s problem, create same scenario your PC, try out and then post the answer ! I am, sort of new to the forums and sometimes for whole of week, I am unable to post any answers, even knowing something about the issue someone has posted. Just the “time” thing. These days I am very close to OTN forums, visit for whole of the day and also post answers to the questions I know something about. There are many people who are regular visitors and are answering questions on the daily basis. Hats off ! to all these “big bosses” of the technology !</p>
