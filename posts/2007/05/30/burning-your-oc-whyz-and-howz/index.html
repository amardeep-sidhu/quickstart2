<p>The very first question that may come to your mind is: what the heck this “OC” is ? Well if PC stands for Personal Computer then OC stands for Office Computer 😉 The story behind all this is:</p>
<p>One of my friend (He is working in a non-IT company) called me and asked how to burn a PC so that it no more works 🙂 Why ? because the PC they are given is too slow &amp; old and thats the only way they can get a new one. I thought for a while and 1 or 2 ideas came to my mind. But to dig into little more details I called my friend <a href="http://rollercoasters-bunker.blogspot.com/">Vaibhav</a> ( The guy I call to “discuss” and “know more about” all the techie things) He gave some really nice ideas. Combining all the thoughts, here is the summary of all the methods that you can use 😉</p>
<ol>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Water the motherboard:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Add a bit of salt to water, fill a syringe and use it to spread water on the motherboard before booting. It will blow the motherboard.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stop processor’s fan: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One more thing put something in the processer’s fan to stop it so that processor gets heated and it stops 🙂 but here chances are more that the system will shutdown or restart.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Break pin(s) of processor:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Another interesting and simple thing that you can do is, break one or more pins of processor and put it back in the slot.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remove one or more ICs: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another thing that you can do is remove one or more ICs from the board. As the board is already so clumsy, nobody can see that anything has been removed from there.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Use Pencil:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Use a carbon pencil and rub it on the golden plating of RAM slots, any ICs near CPU or BIOS. Its gonna spoil that 😉</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cut some wire:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> A very simple method you can use is that cut some wires or data cables in such a way that nobody can see it 😉</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One update from comments posted by Vaibhav: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Most of u might not know abt the voltage selector switch at the back of the SMPS in the CPU tower. It is there to select between 110V(american) and 230V(indian). The trick is to just switch it to 110V 🙂 The SMPS has no protection of over voltage at this high level and will burn instantly.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Advantages:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-No need to open PC<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-No Smoke or sparks<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Nothing can be found on u if checked(like syringe, screw driver or wire cutter)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Instant<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-One Second Job<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Can be done again and again if system repaired<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Disadvantages:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-Replacing SMPS makes the system operational<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Well, few things you can try if you too have an old computer in the office. Best of OC Burning 😛</p>
