<main>
<p>Yesterday, I was troubleshooting a PL/SQL procedure which was giving <em>ORA-06502: PL/SQL: numeric or value error: host bind array too small.</em> Another procedure was being called from within the first one. Finally after some struggle, I was able to find out that there was an insert [inserting to a table on a remote database (say B)] which was causing the whole trouble.</p>
<p>I ran the insert statement in SQL* Plus and it showed a trigger failing [on the table which was being inserted data into]. So there was all the secret ðŸ˜‰ Actually there was an <em>on insert</em> trigger [on the table, in the remote database] which was selecting a value from a sequence on the remote [the first] database and code was written like</p>
<p>&lt;code&gt;select SEQUENCE. CURRVAL blah blah &lt;/code&gt;</p>
<p>As the thing was being done remotely, so it was a new session and doing SEQUENCE.CURRVAL before SEQUENCE.NEXTVAL was not possible. But the NEXTVAL thing will increment</p>
