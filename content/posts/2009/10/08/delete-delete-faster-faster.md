2-3 days ago, I came across a code, intended to make delete faster. Just have a look ðŸ˜‰

```
<pre class="brush: sql; title: ; notranslate" title="">.
.
.
LOOP
SELECT COUNT (1)
INTO v_cnt
FROM table1
WHERE ROWNUM < 2;

IF v_cnt = 0
THEN
EXIT;
END IF;

DELETE FROM table1
WHERE ROWNUM < 1000;

COMMIT;
v_cnt := 0;
END LOOP;
.
.
.
```
