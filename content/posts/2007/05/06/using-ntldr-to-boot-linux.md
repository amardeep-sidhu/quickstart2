Sometimes, while installing Linux, installing LILO/GRUB to MBR makes you run into loads of issues, one of the most popular being that after reboot you are not able to boot into either of the OS ðŸ˜‰ There is a way to use NTLDR to boot Linux, this way the MBR remains untouched and if you donâ€™t want to see the Linux option, what you need to do is, edit your boot.ini and your are done.

For this while installing GRUB, install it to the partition where you are installing Linux, instead of MBR. Now after rebooting, Linux will not boot as the partition on which you installed GRUB is not active. What actually we will do is, copy first 512 bytes of the partition where GRUB is installed, make a bin file, copy it to C drive and add the path of the same to boot.ini. So now, when you select Linux from the list of options displayed, NTLDR will call GRUB and then GRUB will boot Linux, just like normal.

There is a small utility called bootpart that does this all for us. [Here](http://www.winimage.com/bootpa26.zip) is the direct link. Extract it and go to command prompt.

```
<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate" title="">C:\bootpart>dir

Volume in drive C has no label.
Volume Serial Number is 08E8-E412

Directory of C:\bootpart

```

Run <span style="font-weight: bold">bootpart</span>, it will show all the partitions on the disk like

```
<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate" title="">
C:\bootpart>bootpart
Boot Partition 2.60 for WinNT/2K/XP (c)1995-2005 G. Vollant (info@winimage.com)

```

Now the one at 8th number is my native Linux partition. Now run <span style="font-weight: bold">bootpart 8 c:\\linux.bin</span> (Here 8 is my Linux partition number and linux.bin is the name of the file which it will create in C drive) It automatically adds the entry to boot.ini So now you are ready to go. Just reboot and you will see 2 options there. Windows &amp; Linux ðŸ™‚

Happy NTLDRâ€™ingâ€¦
