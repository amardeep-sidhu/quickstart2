<p>Few days back, I had to give Oracle DBA training to a group of about 20-25 semi-technical people (Semi-technical, because most of them were not really DBA kinda folks doing all the techie stuff with Oracle, but in-fact having learned some bits &amp; bytes of Oracle sometime back and these days looking into application functionality from technical perspective). I, having just about 10 months of experience with DBA profile, had to cover, everything about Oracle starting from creating database and up to performance tuning 🙂 Its really an interesting job if the audience is good. But not an easy game. You have to know everything and have to be ready to answer people’s queries (some stupid &amp; dumb questions also 🙂 I had to cover a total of about 350 slides in a day or less. So at times, really went fast and skipping some of things. It was a nice experience as a whole 🙂</p>
<p>&amp; in the end when I finished it, was dead tired 🙁</p>
<p>Hats off to the trainers, who stand for the full day and that too for many days continuously 🙂</p>
