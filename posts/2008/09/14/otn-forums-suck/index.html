<p>Okay, so kids have stopped crying as they got some milk from their mommy: forums are better now (than when came back after an upgrade). There are reasons that it takes time for the things to be smooth. Fine. But what drives me mad is the way Oracle handled this and now ? The font size and those bloody bullets on left side which tell you if you have read the post before ? Please let me know if someone can interpret what those bullets tell and can read the forum without doing Ctrl + in Mozilla/Chrome and suffering from reading everything in large font size in IE 6 ?</p>
<p>Is Oracle a bunch of duffers ? Can’t they see these two simple things ? And i don’t think that these simple changes call for editing some code written in assembly language ?</p>
<p>Grrrrrrrrrrrrr………..</p>
