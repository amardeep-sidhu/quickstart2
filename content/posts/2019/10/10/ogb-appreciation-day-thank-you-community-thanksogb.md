It was [started by Tim Hall](https://oracle-base.com/blog/2019/09/30/ogb-appreciation-day-2019-thanksogb/) in 2016. This is a Thank you community post. There are so many experts posting on Oracle related forums, doing blog posts, sharing their scripts with everyone. All of you are doing a great job. I would like to mention three names especially:

[Tim Hall](https://oracle-base.com/) : Tim is a legend ! I donâ€™t consider something a new feature until Tim writes about it ðŸ˜€

[Jonathan Lewis](https://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/all-postings/) : I donâ€™t think there is anyone on this planet who has even once worked on a performance problem and hasnâ€™t gained something from the knowledge shared by him on forums or in one of the blog posts.

[Tanel Poder](https://blog.tanelpoder.com/) : His hacking sessions, blog posts and scripts are awesome. And [ashtop](https://github.com/tanelpoder/tpt-oracle/blob/master/ash/ashtop.sql) is amazing man !

Thank you all of you. We learn from everyone of you. Keep rocking !
