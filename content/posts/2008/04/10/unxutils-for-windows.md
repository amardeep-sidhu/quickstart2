<div class="ArwC7c ckChnd" id="1el8"><div>If you are used to work in Unix enviroment and then sometime, in between have to sit on Windows and tail -f alert_DB.log, its a real pain. There is a small bundle of utilities, called [Unxutils](http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/) which can make you feel at home in Windows too. These are the exe’s of all major commands in Unix like more, less, ls, grep etc…</div><div></div><div></div><div>To use it just download the zip file from the link above, extract it to some folder and add the path of exe’s to your Windows PATH. Restart your machine and you are done.</div><div>Happy more’ing…less’ing…</div></div>
