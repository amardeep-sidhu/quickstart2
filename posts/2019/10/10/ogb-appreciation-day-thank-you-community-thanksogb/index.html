<p>It was <a href="https://oracle-base.com/blog/2019/09/30/ogb-appreciation-day-2019-thanksogb/">started by Tim Hall</a> in 2016. This is a Thank you community post. There are so many experts posting on Oracle related forums, doing blog posts, sharing their scripts with everyone. All of you are doing a great job. I would like to mention three names especially:</p>
<p><a href="https://oracle-base.com/">Tim Hall</a> : Tim is a legend ! I donâ€™t consider something a new feature until Tim writes about it ðŸ˜€</p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/all-postings/">Jonathan Lewis</a> : I donâ€™t think there is anyone on this planet who has even once worked on a performance problem and hasnâ€™t gained something from the knowledge shared by him on forums or in one of the blog posts.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.tanelpoder.com/">Tanel Poder</a> : His hacking sessions, blog posts and scripts are awesome. And <a href="https://github.com/tanelpoder/tpt-oracle/blob/master/ash/ashtop.sql">ashtop</a> is amazing man !</p>
<p>Thank you all of you. We learn from everyone of you. Keep rocking !</p>
