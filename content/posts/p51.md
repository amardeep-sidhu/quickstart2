Yesterday, I was troubleshooting a PL/SQL procedure which was giving *ORA-06502: PL/SQL: numeric or value error: host bind array too small.* Another procedure was being called from within the first one. Finally after some struggle, I was able to find out that there was an insert \[inserting to a table on a remote database (say B)\] which was causing the whole trouble.

I ran the insert statement in SQL\* Plus and it showed a trigger failing \[on the table which was being inserted data into\]. So there was all the secret ðŸ˜‰ Actually there was an *on insert* trigger \[on the table, in the remote database\] which was selecting a value from a sequence on the remote \[the first\] database and code was written like

&lt;code&gt;select SEQUENCE. CURRVAL blah blah &lt;/code&gt;

As the thing was being done remotely, so it was a new session and doing SEQUENCE.CURRVAL before SEQUENCE.NEXTVAL was not possible. But the NEXTVAL thing will increment
