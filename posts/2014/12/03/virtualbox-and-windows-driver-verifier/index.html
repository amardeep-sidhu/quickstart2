<p>I was troubleshooting some Windows hangs on my Desktop system running Windows 8 and enabled driver verifier. Today when I tried to start VirtualBox it failed with this error message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Failed to load VMMR0.r0 (VERR_LDR_MISMATCH_NATIVE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the online forums were asking to reinstall VirtualBox to fix the issue. But <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21654596/suddenly-getting-failed-to-load-vmmr0-r0-verr-ldr-mismatch-native-in-virtual">one of the thread</a> mentioned that it was being caused by Windows Driver Verifier. I disabled it, restarted Windows and VirtualBox worked like a charm. Didnâ€™t have time to do more research as i quickly wanted to test something. May be we can skip some particular stuff from Driver Verifier and VirutalBox can then work.</p>
