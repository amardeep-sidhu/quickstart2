<p>Just had a glimpse. OTN forums has got a new look. A bunch of new features has also been added. Some of the new things i noticed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>That simple editor is now rich text editor. Also supports emoticons.</li>
<li>You can add tags to a post and it displays the tag cloud (for all the posts) on right side.</li>
<li>A post can be marked as a question and then there will be some points system based on answers.</li>
<li>That list of Top users doesn‚Äôt show those users n ACEs. It display a new list of people instead.</li>
<li>Report Abuse button has been added (with each reply).</li>
</ul>
<p>May be there are some other changes too. That is what i noticed in the very first look.</p>
<p>Nice change indeed ! I am not happy with the font though, it is very small üôÅ</p>
