      <description>While provisioning compute instances in OCI, you may come across scenarios which need more memory and cores than what the standard shapes provide. Extended memory VMs are meant to solve that problem. Such VMs are able to access cores and memory across a single physical socket and it allows them to go beyond the limits of standard shapes. There are no additional charges for using this specific feature. Customer is charged on the basis of total number of cores and total amount of memory used.</description>

      <description>Last week, got this issue reported by a DBA that he wasn‚Äôt able to su to oracle user from root on a Oracle Base Database VM in OCI. The login of opc user worked fine and he could do sudo su to root but he couldn‚Äôt su to oracle. When he did it just came back to root shell.</description>

      <description>A customer is using an Exadata X8M-2 machine with multiple VMs (hence multiple clusters). I was working on adding a new storage cell to the configuration. After creating griddisks on the new cell and updating cellip.ora on all the VMs, I noticed that none of the clusters was able to see the new griddisks. I checked the usual suspects like if asm_diskstring was set properly, private network subnet mask on new cell was same as the old ones.</description>

      <description>A customer who is using an Exadata X8M-2 with multiple VMs had Smokescreen deployed in their company recently and they reported an issue that one of the Smokescreen decoy servers in their DC was seeing traffic from one of the Exadata VMs on a certain port. That was rather confusing as that port was the database listener port on that VM and why would a VM with Oracle RAC deployed try to access any random IP on the listener port.</description>

      <description>It was actually funny. So thought about posting it that sometimes how we can miss the absolute basics. This customer is using a virtualized Exadata with multiple VMs. One VM hosts the database meant to be used for dbfs and another VM connects to this DB over IB to mount dbfs file system using dbfs_client. One day VMs were rebooted and due to some reason the dbfs filesystem didn‚Äôt mount on startup.</description>

      <description>To put it in bit of an Indian context, database is not your daughter-in-law that you can blame it for every performance issue that occurs in the environment. But it does happen. Most of the time it is the database that is blamed for all such issues. Many times, the issues are in some other layer like OS, network or storage.
Faced this issue recently at one of the customer sites where performance in one of the databases went down suddenly.</description>

      <description>To be honest, Fernando Simon has already documented all the steps needed in ZDLRA patching . So this post is more like a reference post for me and it points to the links on his blog. One thing he could change though are the post titles. He also agrees üòâ
The RA library patching part can be considered of two different types. This is an important difference. Make sure that you follow the right set of commands.</description>

      <description>Faced this while running installer for setting up a 2 node RAC setup (version 19.8) on an Oracle SuperCluster. The error reported in the log is:
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;From the error it appears that the ssh is not setup between two nodes but actually that is not the case. Here the error message is bit misleading. It turned out to be an issue with scp with openssh version 8.x. Running the setup with -debug option gives the clue: &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code &amp;#34;&amp;gt;``` &amp;lt;pre class=&amp;#34;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&amp;#34; title=&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;protocol error: filename does not match request&amp;gt; Workaround is to pass the -T option to scp to ignore the new checks.</description>

      <description>Earlier versions of OEDA didn‚Äôt allow you to have mixed cells in the configuration i.e. High Capacity (HC) and Extreme Flash (EF). The way to deal with that configuration was that deploy the system with either HC or EF cells and then manually configure the remaining cells.
I am not sure when did it change but the newer versions allow you have mixed type of cells in a single OEDA configuration.</description>

      <description>In part 1, we discussed few things that you should take care before implementation of a ZDLRA. In this post, we will discuss few more things that you should review before or at the time of implementation:
If you are getting two ZDLRAs (one each for primary and standby sites), there are two ways they can be deployed. One scenario is where all the primary databases (or the database that have no standby) backup to RA at the primary site and then the data is replicated from primary RA to RA at the standby site.</description>

      <description>Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (ZDLRA) is Oracle‚Äôs solution for database backups. It has many advantages over other backup solutions that are available in the market. This post has a brief introduction to ZDLRA and few links for further reading. This is a quick post about few of things that you should keep in mind if you are planning to get a ZDLRA (RA in short). Of course, there is a lot more that is needed while executing the whole plan, but these are some of the basics:</description>

      <description>Exadata storage software version 20.1 introduces a new feature called ‚ÄúSecure Fabric‚Äù for KVM based multi cluster deployments (Exadata X8M). It enables network isolation between multiple tenants (i.e. KVM VMs based RAC clusters). This feature aligns with Infiniband Partitioning on OVM based systems. There are customers who in such scenarios want that VMs of one RAC shouldn‚Äôt be able to see traffic of the other RAC VMs. This feature achieves that.</description>

      <description>There are two common scenarios when we may need this:
An existing DB node has crashed and is unrecoverable (due to some failure and non-availability of any backups. Though some of the things may need to be done even if the backups were available). We have an existing Exadata rack that is virtualized. Now there is a new DB node and the existing clusters need to be extended to include the VMs on this new node.</description>

So that was the time to download and install 12.2.0.10.0. The installation started fine but it failed with an error:</description>

      <description>Use of Exadata storage cells seems to be a very poorly understood concept. A lot of people have confusions about how exactly ASM makes uses of disks from storage cells. Many folks assume there is some sort of RAID configured in the storage layer whereas there is nothing like that. I will try to explain some of the concepts in this post.
Let‚Äôs take an example of an Exadata quarter rack that has 2 db and 3 storage nodes (node means a server here).</description>

      <description>It is actually a dumb one. I was disabling triggers in a schema and ran this SQL to generate the disable statements. (Example from here)
&amp;lsquo;ALTERTRIGGER&amp;rsquo;||TRIGGER_NAME||&amp;lsquo;DISABLE;&amp;rsquo; alter trigger PRICE_HISTORY_TRIGGERv1 disable;
HR@test&amp;gt; alter trigger PRICE_HISTORY_TRIGGERv1 disable; alter trigger PRICE_HISTORY_TRIGGERv1 disable * ERROR at line 1: ORA-04080: trigger &amp;lsquo;PRICE_HISTORY_TRIGGERV1&amp;rsquo; does not exist
HR@test&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;WTF ? It is there but the disable didn‚Äôt work. I was in hurry, tried to connect through SQL developer and disable and it worked !</description>

      <description>This is an Exadata machine running GI version 18.3.0.0.180717 and DB version 12.1.0.2.180717. On one of the DB nodes while running dbca, it doesn‚Äôt list the diskgroups. it works fine on the other node.
I cheked the dbca trace and found that the kfod command was failing. I tried to run it manually and got the same error:

      <description>It started with an xls sheet (that was called dbm configurator) . Then OEDA (Oracle Exadata Deployment Assistant) was introduced that was a Java based GUI tool to enter all the information needed to configure an Exadata machine. Now with the latest patch released in Oct, OEDA has changed again; to become a web based tool. It is deployed on WebLogic and comes with some new features as well. SuperCluster deployments will continue to use the Java based OEDA tool.</description>

      <description>So if you are filling an OEDA for Exadata deployment there are few things you should take care of. Most of the screens are self explanatory but there are some bits where one should focus little more. I am running the Aug version of it and the screenshots below are from that version.
On the Define customer networks screen, the client network is the actual network where your data is going to flow.</description>

      <description>Faced this error while querying v$asm_disk after adding new storage cell IPs to cellip.ora on DB nodes of an existing cluster on Exadata. Query ends with ORA-03113 end-of-file on communication channel and ORA-56841 is reported in $ORA_CRS_HOME/log/&amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;/diskmon/diskmon.log. Reason in my case was that the new cell was using different subnet for IB. It was pingable from the db nodes but querying v$asm_disk wasn‚Äôt working. Changing the subnet for IB on new cell to the one on existing cells fixed the issue.</description>

ORA-01671: control file is a backup, cannot make a standby control file A quick search reveals that it is bug 11715084 that affects most of the 11.x versions except 11.2.0.4. There is a one off patch available for most of the versions or one can install the bundle patch that includes the fix for this patch.</description>

      <description>This was my 6th year at Sangam and as always was good fun. We were a group of 4 people who were traveling from Delhi and we reached Hyderabad on Friday morning. Just wanted to keep a day for visiting Ramoji Film City and also wanted to avoid the rush that morning travel on the conference‚Äôs starting day brings. So after dropping the luggage at the hotel we hired a taxi and reached Ramoji Film City.</description>

      <description>A rather not so great post about an ORA-00600 error i faced on a standby database. Environement was 11.2.0.3 on Sun Super Cluster machine. MRP process was hitting ORA-00600 while trying to apply a specific archive log.
The error message was something like this
MRP0: Background Media Recovery terminated with error 600 Errors in file /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0.3/diag/diag/rdbms/xxxprd/xxxprd1/trace/xxxprd1_pr00_6342.trc: ORA-00600: internal error code, arguments: &amp;lt;span style=&amp;#34;color: #ff0000;&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;[2619]&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;, [539], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [] Recovery interrupted!</description>

      <description>Many people have asked me this question that how they can learn Exadata ? It starts sounding even more difficult as a lot of people don‚Äôt have access to Exadata environments. So thought about writing a small post on the same.
It actually is not as difficult as it sounds. There are a lot of really good resources available from where you can learn about Exadata architecture and the things that work differently from any non-Exadata platform.</description>

      <description>I was troubleshooting some Windows hangs on my Desktop system running Windows 8 and enabled driver verifier. Today when I tried to start VirtualBox it failed with this error message.
Failed to load VMMR0.r0 (VERR_LDR_MISMATCH_NATIVE)
Most of the online forums were asking to reinstall VirtualBox to fix the issue. But one of the thread mentioned that it was being caused by Windows Driver Verifier. I disabled it, restarted Windows and VirtualBox worked like a charm.</description>

      <description>So there is a new toy in the market for database geeks : Oracle has released database 12c. Every social platform is abuzz with the 12c activity. So thought that I should also complete the ritual In this post Aman has already summed up many important links.
Maria Colgan has posted some useful links here.
And here is a link to a slidedeck about Upgrading and Migrating to 12c.
Happy 12c‚Äôing !</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was configuring EM 12c for a Sun Super Cluster system. There were a total of 4 LDOMs where I needed to deploy the agent (Setup ‚Äì&amp;gt; Add targets ‚Äì&amp;gt; Add targets manually). Out of these 4 everything went fine for 2 LDOMs but for the other two it failed with an error message. It didn‚Äôt give much details on the EM screen but rather gave a message to try to secure/start the agent manually.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note about change in the way the compute nodes are patched starting from version 11.2.3.1.1. For earlier versions Oracle provided the minimal pack for patching the compute nodes. Starting with version 11.2.3.1.1 Oracle has discontinued the minimal pack and the updates to compute nodes are done via Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN).
Now there are three ways to update the compute nodes:
1) You have internet access on the Compute nodes.</description>

SQL&amp;gt; alter function SCOTT.SOME_FUNCTION compile; alter function SCOTT.SOME_FUNCTION compile * ERROR at line 1: ORA-00604: error occurred at recursive SQL level 1 ORA-01422: exact fetch returns more than requested number of rows ORA-06512: at line 27 SQL&amp;gt; At first look it sounded like some issue with the dictionary as the error in case of every object (be it a view, function or package) was the same.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you may need to run GoldenGate on some different machine than the one that hosts the database. It is very much possible but some kind of restrictions apply. First is that the Endian order of both the systems should be same and the second is the bit width has to be same. For example it is not possible to run GoldenGate on a 32 bit system to read from a database that runs on some 64 bit platform.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note/post about the significance of COMPRESS and TCPBUFSIZE parameter in performance of a GoldenGate Extract Pump process. COMPRESS helps in compressing the outgoing blocks hence helping in better utilization of the bandwidth from source to target. GG is going to uncompress the blocks before writing them to the remote trail file on the target. Compression ratios of 4:1 or better can be achieved. Of course, use of COMPRESS may result in increased CPU usage on both the sides.</description>

      <description>Hybrid Columnar Compression (HCC) is a new awesome feature in Exadata that helps in saving a lot of storage space in your environment. This whitepaper on Oracle website explains this feature in detail. Also Uwe Hesse has an excellent how to use all this post on his blog. You can see the compression levels one can achive by making use of HCC. It is very simple to use feature but one needs to be aware of few things before using HCC extensively as otherwise all your storage calculations may go weird.</description>

      <description>The last post was just like that. It was this GoldenGate issue that woke me up from the deep sleep to do a post after a long time üòõ .
Well it was a simple schema to schema replication setup using GoldenGate. We were using the SCN method (Metalink Doc ID 1276058.1 &amp;amp; 1347191.1) to do the intial load so that there is no overlvapping of transactions and the replicat runs with minimum issues.</description>

      <description>Came across this small oddity that documentation of 10.2 and 11.2 states that expdp by default takes consistent image of the database. But actually it is not so. You need to use flashback_scn/flashback_time for that. Metalink doc 377218.1 explains the scenario.</description>

      <description>It was a 10g (10.2.0.5 on HP-UX 11.23 RISC) database which was recently upgraded from 9.2.0.8. The CPU and memory utilization was going really high. After tuning few of the queries coming in top, CPU usage was coming within accetable limits but the memory usage was still high. There was a total of 16 GB of RAM on the server and the usage was above 90%, constantly. One of the reasons behind high usage was increase in the SGA size.</description>

The major applications connecting to the database were developed in Pro*C and Oracle Forms. The upgrade itself pretty smooth but there were few glitches around that needed to be handled. Just thought about documenting all the issues:

LOOP SELECT COUNT (1) INTO v_cnt FROM table1 WHERE ROWNUM &amp;lt; 2; IF v_cnt = 0 THEN EXIT; END IF; DELETE FROM table1 WHERE ROWNUM &amp;lt; 1000; COMMIT; v_cnt := 0; END LOOP; . . . </description>

      <description>Yesterday, one of my colleague asked that if he traced a wrap‚Äôed PL/SQL procedure, would the SQL statements show up in the trace ? Very simple thing but at that moment i got, sort of into doubt. So i ran a simple test and yes they do show up üòâ
&amp;lt;pre class=&amp;#34;brush: sql; title: ; notranslate&amp;#34; title=&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;gt;CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE wrap1 AS v_today DATE; BEGIN SELECT SYSDATE INTO v_today FROM DUAL; END; / C:\&amp;gt;wrap iname=wrap1.</description>

      <description>Today one of my colleague was working on development of a screen in Oracle Forms to give the end user an option to schedule a job using dbms_scheduler. With the hope that i would be able to explain it properly, the whole scenario is like this:
User will log in to the application with his username (Lets say USER01) and password (basically every application user is a database user). He is provided with a screen where he can enter details about the job and the code behind the button calls a PL/SQL procedure in the main application schema (lets say APP1) which in turn uses DBMS_SCHEDULER.</description>

Day before yesterday a colleague at my workplace asked that she was running an SQL script (which contained a simple DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH() statement to refresh an MVIEW), it ran successfully but after completion re-ran the last command run in the session.</description>

      <description>One of my friend today asked me about removing Linux partitions &amp;amp; GRUB (from a dual boot system) and return back to windows alone. Removing Linux involves just formatting/removing the partitions. Now to remove GRUB either do fdisk /mbr from a Windows 98 bootable CD or do fixmbr after booting into repair mode with Windows XP CD. But if you have none then to remove GRUB you will need some utility like this one and if you reboot before doing that it might make GRUB unable to boot into Windows.</description>

      <description>Okay, so kids have stopped crying as they got some milk from their mommy: forums are better now (than when came back after an upgrade). There are reasons that it takes time for the things to be smooth. Fine. But what drives me mad is the way Oracle handled this and now ? The font size and those bloody bullets on left side which tell you if you have read the post before ?</description>

      <description>Well, as everybody has seen, last week they have again upgraded the OTN forums. And sadly it has been handled in a very poor manner. End result is that it is running terribly slow and throwing some errors many times. In my office, i cant even open it properly may be its too heavy or some issue with the internet. Also there has been lots of hues and cries about the new point system and all.</description>

      <description>My company uses Lotus Notes for email and Sametime connect as messenger for all the internal communication. Both are stupid applications and are a big resource hogs. Most of the systems are P IV with 512 MB RAM. You just run Lotus and Sametime 7 and it eats up everything. The system moves like a 386 based machine.
Moreover, i was looking for Lotus short cuts today and found that there is no short cut in Lotus for Send/Receive mail.</description>

We are having a 3 tier setup where Oracle Application Server 10g was there on AIX 5.3. It runs Apache HTTP server and we needed to access the files outside DocumentRoot. A bit of googling revealed that we could use Alias for that. Basically we need to add the following small piece of text to httpd.</description>

      <description>Our application (3 tier, Front end Forms10g and back end 10gR2) provides user with a front end to refresh the mviews. That form has 2 columns showing mview name and the comment against it. Recently i saw that while opening this front end ORA-01403 NO DATA FOUND was being raised.
I opened the fmb and found that it was populating comments from DBA_TAB_COMMENTS. In 10g the comments against mviews are stored in DBA_MVIEW_COMMENTS unlike till 9i where it was in ALL_TAB_COMMENTS.</description>

I disabled it for the time being and installed WP-SpamFree.

That simple editor is now rich text editor. Also supports emoticons. You can add tags to a post and it displays the tag cloud (for all the posts) on right side. A post can be marked as a question and then there will be some points system based on answers.</description>

      <description>Today I was checking OTN forums and came across a thread. OP‚Äôs concern was:
One of the db i am supporting has about 3.3 Terabytes capacity and the application is using only 1 huge tablespace with one big file.
the system is linux 4 , 32 bit.
oracle version is 10.2.0.4
Is there a limit of space for a tablespace when you consider insert/delete/query performance?

      <description>I had got an export of a database and had to import it to a new database. The only difference was that in new database few of the large tables were partitioned. So instead of partitioning it after the import, i thought about pre-creating the tables (with partitioning) and then run import with ignore=Y . Everything went fine. But later on the front end application gave some error and we came to know that default values for columns in some tables were not set.</description>

      <description>I recently upgraded my blog to WordPress 2.5. The manual process is real cumbersome. Today I came across few plugins which help in almost automating the upgrade stuff.
WordPress Automatic upgrade: As per description this plugin first takes backup and then upgrades. I didn‚Äôt try this one, though.
Instant Upgrade: I upgraded one of my blog using this. It doesn‚Äôt take care of backup but otherwise the upgrade was super smooth.</description>

I googled a bit and came across another small utility called Tera Copy. Its just 1 MB download and replaces Windows copy/paste.</description>

      <description>Today one of my colleague was working on a simple PL/SQL procedure. Based on some logic it was returning count(*) from all_tab_columns for few tables. It gave count incorrectly for one table out of around fifty in total. He just hard coded the table name and ran it but again it showed count as zero.
Then he took the code out of procedure and wrote it in DECLARE, BEGIN, END and after running it showed the correct count.</description>

Another procedure was being called from within the first one. Finally after some struggle, I was able to find out that there was an insert [inserting to a table on a remote database (say B)] which was causing the whole trouble.
I ran the insert statement in SQL* Plus and it showed a trigger failing [on the table which was being inserted data into].</description>

      <description>Today one of my friends called me to ask about ORA-01537: cannot add file ‚Äòc:\test1.dbf‚Äô ‚Äì file already part of database. The simple reason for this could be that the datafile I am trying to add to a tablespace is already there. But no, in this case it was not like this. The tablespace was not there in DBA_TABLESPACES but the datafile was there in DBA_DATA_FILES and V$DATAFILE. Also the file has been physically deleted from the disk.</description>

      <description>At my workplace we were facing a problem with refresh of a mview. Say it was created in schema of user1 but when I tried to refresh it from user2 it would give ORA-03113: end-of-file on communication channel. Then we raised a SR and have been following up with Oracle support for long but it was not getting anywhere. Yesterday that guy seemed to have reached some point. The mviews that we have created and are having problem with refresh are created on top of both local &amp;amp; remote objects and he said that up to 11gr2 there is no possibility of creating mviews on both local and remote objects.</description>

      <description>Tom Kyte did a post on his blog about posting of reviews of questions on Asktom. In a nutshell the reviews not related to the original question will be ignored/deleted (not decided yet, as Tom said).
As other people said in the comments, personally I too like this idea very much. Earlier, many times, there were questions which started with someone asking about appropriate SGA size, then there were some other twists and discussions and then the thread ended in discussion about good or bad authors or something similar light years away from the original topic.</description>

      <title>UNDO tablespace in Oracle&amp;#8230;</title>

      <description>Today, I was following a thread on Oracle Forums. Someone asked a question about UNDO tablespace wrt to a scenario. The question was:
There is a database and its hot backup is taken on Friday. Now for Saturday, Sunday and Monday there are archive logs but no backups. Suppose the machine crashes on Monday. After we restore the database to Friday (from backup), recovery will happen. As UNDO tablespace is of Friday so it has no information related to transactions that happened on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.</description>

      <description>Being a new kid on the block, I think, my post will not fire any serious and ‚Äúscary‚Äù discussion as it has happened many times in the past. Just writing my experience. Whenever I search something related to Oracle in Google there are few sites that are bound to come up in the very first results ( No surety about the relevance and completeness of the content, though). Today I was searching about scheduling new jobs in oracle and I was, sort of, surprised to see the results [Though, I got from there, what I was looking for &amp;amp; I would like to say Thanks for that].</description>

      <description>Few days back, I had to give Oracle DBA training to a group of about 20-25 semi-technical people (Semi-technical, because most of them were not really DBA kinda folks doing all the techie stuff with Oracle, but in-fact having learned some bits &amp;amp; bytes of Oracle sometime back and these days looking into application functionality from technical perspective). I, having just about 10 months of experience with DBA profile, had to cover, everything about Oracle starting from creating database and up to performance tuning üôÇ Its really an interesting job if the audience is good.</description>

      <description>Many times, we are required to restore a database from an export dmp file. Its a simple task but sometimes there are some issues left like invalid objects or some objects missing, in the newly created database. Following steps, followed in order can help in creating an error free database:
Create a blank database: The very first step is to create a blank database which is to be used as the target database.</description>

Eddie Awad about 11g, I think he was the first one to post
Then Doug Burns here
Howard on installing 11g

      <description>I have been installing Linux for last 6 years and for more than half the number of times, came across a message something like ‚ÄúThis partitions is beyond the 1024 cylinder boundary and may not be bootable‚Äù.

Yesterday I was reading System Admin guide to Linux by Lars Wirzenius (Thanks Howard for the link üôÇ From there I came to know what exactly that message meant.</description>

      <description>In my last post I discussed about moving datafiles. But if we want to move control files and redo files also, then the scenario is bit different. Lets see an example of the same. The current scenario is as follows:
SQL&amp;gt; select * from v$logfile;GROUP# STATUS TYPE MEMBER---------- ------- ------- ------------------------------------ 3 STALE ONLINE C:\ORACLE\ORADATA\ORCL1\REDO03.LOG 2 ONLINE C:\ORACLE\ORADATA\ORCL1\REDO02.LOG 1 ONLINE C:\ORACLE\ORADATA\ORCL1\REDO01.LOG SQL&amp;gt; select * from v$controlfile; STATUS NAME------- -------------------------------------------------------C:\ORACLE\ORADATA\ORCL1\CONTROL01.CTLC:\ORACLE\ORADATA\ORCL1\CONTROL02.CTLC:\ORACLE\ORADATA\ORCL1\CONTROL03.CTL SQL&amp;gt; select tablespace_name,file_name from dba_data_files; TABLESPACE_NAME FILE_NAME------------------------------ --------------------------------------SYSTEM C:\ORACLE\ORADATA\ORCL1\SYSTEM01.</description>

      <description>Many times you need to move datafiles from one location to another. The simplest approach for this is to take the tablespace offline, copy the datafiles to new location, rename the files with alter database rename file (Except that you dont have to move the SYSTEM and UNDO tablespace, as you can‚Äôt take SYSTEM tablespace offline)
&amp;lt;pre class=&amp;#34;brush: css; title: ; notranslate&amp;#34; title=&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;gt; SYS@orcl AS SYSDBA&amp;gt; alter tablespace system offline; alter tablespace system offline * ERROR at line 1: ORA-01541: system tablespace cannot be brought offline; shut down if necessary SYS@orcl AS SYSDBA&amp;gt; Well lets try moving USERS tablespace.</description>

      <description>One may encounter this error while importing from a dmp file from older versions of Oracle. Genereally this error is caused by some statement like alter session set current_schema=scott; And the simple reason is that the user scott doesn‚Äôt exist. Yesterday I came across this error. And the reason was that user was not created. As in case of import we generally create tablespaces first (by creating the DDL using option show=Y) but creation of users is done by import itself.</description>

Started exploring Oracle related forums and websites specially OTN forums (http://forums.oracle.com) This is the only page thats almost always open on my Desktop in office &amp;amp; Laptop at home and I refresh more than my office Lotus Notes. Today I was reading APCs blog , that Jonathan Lewis has also started posting on OTN forums and being so busy man, from where he finds the time ?</description>

      <description>On OTN someone asked a question that how to spool data from a table into a xls file. Spooling a single table I discussed in one of the previous posts. We can use the same approach to spool data from more than 1 table also. Well here I will do it through a shell script and assume that you have a text file having list of tables to be spooled (Even if you don‚Äôt have one, it can be easily made by spooling the names of tables into a simple text file) Here is the shell script that you can use to spool data to various xls files, table wise.</description>

      <description>Well, a simple method to import(export) directly to(from) compressed files using pipes. Its for Unix based systems only, as I am not aware of any pipe type functionality in Windows. The biggest advantage is that you can save lots of space as uncompressing a file makes it almost 5 times or more. (Suppose you are uncompressing a file of 20 GB, it will make 100 GB) As a newbie I faced this problem, so thought about writing a post.</description>

      <description>Well, a really old post on Google groups (uesnet:comp.databases.oracle.server). Someone posted a thread about Tom Kyte and then people responded with their thoughts (perfectly as expected). Read it here.

      <description>Sometimes, while installing Linux, installing LILO/GRUB to MBR makes you run into loads of issues, one of the most popular being that after reboot you are not able to boot into either of the OS üòâ There is a way to use NTLDR to boot Linux, this way the MBR remains untouched and if you don‚Äôt want to see the Linux option, what you need to do is, edit your boot.</description>

      <description>Found a very interesting article on Dizwell‚Äôs blog. It was about keeping history of the SQL commands in SQL Plus on Linux. It is almost very simple. Just need to download a small utility called rlwrap from here. Its a tar.gz file. Download it, un-tar using
&amp;lt;pre class=&amp;#34;brush: css; title: ; notranslate&amp;#34; title=&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;gt; tar -xvf rlwrap-0.28.tar.gz It will create a directory with the same name. cd to the directory and run</description>

      <description>Well, some information about how to go about generating and reading explain plan of a SQL query. Explain plan gives the information about the access path that Oracle is going to follow to execute your query [explain plan doesn‚Äôt actually execute the query, it just tells about the access path that Oracle will follow to execute the query; that too in current session, with all the current settings, it may be totally different in another session on the very same database].</description>

      <description>Well, here I am listing down the important tools and utilities I seem to use on the daily basis and without them life on internet &amp;amp; laptop really seems to be stuck, sort of üôÅ
1. Winamp: No need to say anything. Winamp is possibly the best and lightest mp3 (these days videos also) player. Just run Winamp in the system tray and enjoy
2. Winrar: Utility to uncompress compressed files.</description>

      <description>I was going through Eddie Awad‚Äôs blog. There was one post about an article about NO_DATA_FOUND exception in Oracle. Both the posts you can find here and here. Do read. It is really interesting.

      <description>There are times when you just can‚Äôt do anything, I repeat, you just can‚Äôt do anything. In the evening I was working on my laptop and everything was fine. Next day in the morning when I got up, switched on the laptop and clicked on IE icon, it happily gave a beautiful error message ‚ÄúThis application failed to start because msvcrl.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix the problem.</description>

      <description>When I got my Laptop, along with it also got Norton Internet Security and 2 months subscription for updates &amp;amp; all. Whenever I would boot up the laptop Internet Security would open the window for configuration. I kept on cancelling it for 2 weeks or so. But one fine (read not fine üôÅ day I configured it. It was very happy. Said Thank You at the end. But the best was yet to come.</description>

      <description>I was checking Tom Kyte‚Äôs blog. It was about an article titled A Note To Employers: 8 Things Intelligent People, Geeks and Nerds Need To Work Happily. Well first of all meaning of all three words from ‚Äúdefine: * in Google‚Äù
1. Intelligent: having the capacity for thought and reason especially to a high degree
2. Geek: In computers and the Internet, a geekis a person who is inordinately dedicated to and involved with the technologyto the point of sometimes not appearing to be like the rest of us (non-geeks).</description>

      <description>Running Linux from right inside Windows, just like a normal application !!! Idea looks cool. I was also searching for the same thing. After little bit of Googling got one link http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/beginners-guide-run-linux-like-any-other-program-in-windows.html This article explains everything about making it possible. (Thanks Kyle Pott üôÇ
I had downloaded Fedore Core 7 Live CD. Tried same with this method. It is working perfectly fine. Rocking Infact !!! I have 1 Gigs of RAM in my laptop.</description>

      <description>For the last 4-5 months I was almost without a PC and internet. This problem was solved when I got my HP laptop last month and then internet connection this month. One thing I had heard much about was RSS feeds and also wanted to try the same because there were many blogs which I used to check regularly. I had an idea about the concept used by RSS feeds that you will need to install a piece of software on your PC, give link of the page you want it to monitor and it will inform you when there is something new since your last visit.</description>
