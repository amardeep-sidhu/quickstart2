[Aman](http://amansharma.wordpress.com/) made me aware about not being able to post any comments on my blog. I checked and found that everything was fine with Firefox but in IE 6 it was not possible to post a comment. I was using [Did You Pass Math](http://www.herod.net/dypm/ "Visit plugin homepage") plugin to stop comment spam and it had some problems in IE. I disabled it for the time being and installed [WP-SpamFree](http://www.hybrid6.com/webgeek/plugins/wp-spamfree). Everything seems to be fine except that it doesn‚Äôt allow very small comments and i haven‚Äôt been able to figure out where that setting is ? (yea‚Ä¶i am really poor with this web stuff üôÅ ).

The display of single post in IE is still broken. Some issues with the theme i am using, i guess. Will try to fix that.

If you have any difficulty in reading or commenting on the post, please let me know at amardeepsidhu at gmail dot com.

Thanks üôÇ
