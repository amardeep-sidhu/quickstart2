<p>My name is Amardeep Sidhu. I currently live and work in New Delhi, India. My main technology arena is Oracle on Windows &amp; Unix platforms.</p>
<p>I did my B Tech in Computer Sci &amp; Engg from <a href="http://www.gndu.ac.in/">Guru Nanak Dev University</a>, Punjab, India. I started my first job in 2004 with <a href="http://spiceindia.com/spice/home.asp">Spice Telecom Pvt Ltd</a>, a Mohali based GSM operator operating in Punjab.</p>
<p>I always had thought about programming in C/C++ but was met with Oracle in my first job. I didnâ€™t like Oracle at all and it took a long time for me to actually start getting interested in it. By the time i was leaving my first job (that is in Oct 2006) i had become interested in learning Oracle properly and thought about going for PL/SQL and Java domain. While doing my first job i learned about Oracle, Unix (Solaris to be specific) and also about telecom domain ( yea yeaâ€¦i still remember a little about MSC, IN, CDR etc etc ðŸ˜€ ).</p>
<p>I joined my second job in 2006 but as a DBA ðŸ™‚ Since then i started studying Oracle in details. Learning about architecture and all other stuff. Here, on this blog, i try to collect whatever technology tidbits i come across daily. May be sometimes a little bit of humour too.</p>
<p>Happy reading and commenting ðŸ™‚</p>
