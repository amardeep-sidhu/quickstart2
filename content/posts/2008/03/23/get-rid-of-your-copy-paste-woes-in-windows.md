I was copying some data from a DVD and it stopped in between due to some error with some file. Then I was reminded of [Total Copy](http://www.ranvik.net/totalcopy/) (A small alternate utility to Windows copy) but even thats is not much stable and you have to right click &amp; drag for copy/paste.

I googled a bit and came across another small utility called [Tera Copy](http://www.codesector.com/teracopy.php). Its just 1 MB download and replaces Windows copy/paste. It provides many options like skipping a file, resuming copy and some other stuff. A must have for all Windows users. There is a pro version too.
