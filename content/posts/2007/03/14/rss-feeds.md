<span style="font-family: verdana">For the last 4-5 months I was almost without a PC and internet. This problem was solved when I got my HP laptop last month and then internet connection this month. One thing I had heard much about was RSS feeds and also wanted to try the same because there were many blogs which I used to check regularly. I had an idea about the concept used by RSS feeds that you will need to install a piece of software on your PC, give link of the page you want it to monitor and it will inform you when there is something new since your last visit.(period) Nothing more I knew.</span>

So as I generally do started looking for some good RSS reader(possibly the best ;). From the [<span style="font-family: verdana">very first search in Google</span>](http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&q=rss+reader&meta=)<span style="font-family: verdana"> I opened </span>[<span style="font-family: verdana">the first link</span>](http://www.rssreader.com/)<span style="font-family: verdana"> and downloaded </span>[<span style="font-family: verdana">RSS Reader</span>](http://www.rssreader.com/)<span style="font-family: verdana"> and installed it. Then after installing, had to give the link of RSS feed for the page that you wanted it to monitor. It was very simple copy-paste kind of job. Just took around 2 mins. Now I have added many websites and blogs to it. Every time when there is something new it rings the bell ðŸ™‚
