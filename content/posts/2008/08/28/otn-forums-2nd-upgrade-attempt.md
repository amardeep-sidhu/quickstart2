Well, as everybody has seen, last week they have again upgraded the OTN forums. And sadly it has been handled in a very poor manner. End result is that it is running terribly slow and throwing some errors many times. In my office, i cant even open it properly may be its too heavy or some issue with the internet. Also there has been lots of hues and cries about the new point system and all. That in my opinion is fine except that speed at which forums are running should be fine.

But Oracle itself handling an upgrade like this is really bad. It should have happened in a sweet manner. Or no money comes from OTN, so no experts out there ?

Since the upgrade, i am not feeling like posting and i think number of posts have also gone down.

Lets hope for some improvementsâ€¦
