Today I was checking OTN forums and came across [a thread](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/message.jspa?messageID=2578116). OPâ€™s concern was:

*One of the db i am supporting has about 3.3 Terabytes capacity and the application is using only 1 huge tablespace with one big file.*

*the system is linux 4 , 32 bit.  
oracle version is 10.2.0.4*

*Is there a limit of space for a tablespace when you consider insert/delete/query performance?*

Single datafile of 3.3 TB ðŸ™‚

Awesome !

Kudos to the designer ðŸ˜‰
