Today I was checking [Eddie Awadâ€™s blog](http://awads.net/wp). From there I came to know that [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/) has started [Official Oracle Wiki](http://wiki.oracle.com/) hosted by [Wetpaint](http://www.wetpaint.com/). Check out. I just made my login. Hoping to contribute whatever little I can
