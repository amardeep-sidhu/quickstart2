<p>Since long time i have been struggling to learn CSS and make <a href="http://www.amardeepsidhu.com">my website</a> look great. The efforts did succeed but not in a way i wanted. After playing with CSS for few months i finally switched to Joomla and yes, in a week my website looks pretty cool. CSS automated ðŸ˜‰ . Joomla installation is pretty next-next job. Then play around a bit and you are done. Next game is to choose a nice looking template according to your taste and addition of few extensions to make yours tasks easier. (WordPress &amp; Joomla rock because of these free extensions). So after long time i feel satisfied with the way my website looks. Here are the screenshots of the old and present new look for archives ðŸ˜‰</p>
