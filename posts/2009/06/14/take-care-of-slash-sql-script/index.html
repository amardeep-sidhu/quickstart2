<p>Since long time i have almost been writing useless posts only. Now, i guess my blog doesnâ€™t even look like an Oracle blog. So thought about posting something related to Oracle ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>Day before yesterday a colleague at my workplace asked that she was running an SQL script (which contained a simple DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH() statement to refresh an MVIEW), it ran successfully but after completion re-ran the last command run in the session. I was also puzzled and checked the SQL script but it contained simple DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH() statement. Next try revealed that the script actually had a / (slash) in the second line (with no semi-colon at the end of the first line). Something like this (I used dbms_stats instead of dbms_mview):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;pre class=&#34;brush: sql; title: ; notranslate&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;exec dbms_stats.gather_table_stats(user,&#39;EMP&#39;)
/
</code></pre><p>Now this thing, when run in SQL* Plus session can be confusing:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;pre class=&#34;brush: sql; title: ; notranslate&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;SCOTT@TESTING &gt;
SCOTT@TESTING &gt;delete emp1;
delete emp1
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist

SCOTT@TESTING &gt;@c:\test

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

delete emp1
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist

SCOTT@TESTING &gt;
</code></pre><p>There is no semicolon at the end of the first statement but it executes without that also. So the slash in the 2nd line simply re-executes the last SQL, as expected ðŸ™‚ . But it does get confusing !</p>
