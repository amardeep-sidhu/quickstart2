Faced this error while querying v$asm\_disk after adding new storage cell IPs to cellip.ora on DB nodes of an existing cluster on Exadata. Query ends with *ORA-03113 end-of-file on communication channel* and *ORA-56841* is reported in *$ORA\_CRS\_HOME/log/&lt;hostname&gt;/diskmon/diskmon.log*. Reason in my case was that the new cell was using different subnet for IB. It was pingable from the db nodes but querying v$asm\_disk wasnâ€™t working. Changing the subnet for IB on new cell to the one on existing cells fixed the issue.
