I was just wondering what kind of maintenance OTN forums are undergoing ? It is 2nd day today and still not available. I checked it yesterday morning and now today morning still under maintenance.

Is another new design on the way ? ðŸ˜‰

What you say !

Just noticed that there is [an announcement](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/ann.jspa?annID=808) about the maintenance in Community Feedback forum.

*Due to maintenance, forums.oracle.com will be in read-only mode between 6pm PT, Aug. 8 and 6pm PT, Aug 10. Search will still be available during that time.*

Thanks for your patience during this time!

Lets see when it comes upâ€¦mentioned period is over, i think.
