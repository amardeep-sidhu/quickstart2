The day when Oracle 11g was made available for download on OTN, there was sort of, flood of posts in the Oracle blogsphere. Here is a quick recap of few of the posts (Whatsoever I could find through [OraNA](http://orana.info/) and my [Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/))

[Eddie Awad about 11g](http://awads.net/wp/2007/08/09/download-oracle-database-11g-release-1-now/), I think he was the first one to post
