<span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);font-size:130%;"></span>I was going through [Eddie Awadâ€™s blog](http://awads.net/wp/). There was one post about an article about NO\_DATA\_FOUND exception in Oracle. Both the posts you can find [here](http://awads.net/wp/2007/04/10/no_data_found-gotcha/) and [here](http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/oracle/guide/archives/minitip-9-no-data-found-bug-or-feature-15602). Do read. It is really interesting.
