I came across a very nice post about Autonomous Transactions in Oracle written by [Kevin Meade](http://www.orafaq.com/blog/kevin_meade) on [orafaq](http://www.orafaq.com). Thought about sharing [the link](http://www.orafaq.com/node/1915).

His [blog](http://www.orafaq.com/blog/kevin_meade) also has some very nice stuff.
