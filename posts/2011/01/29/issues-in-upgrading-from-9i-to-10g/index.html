<p>Last week I had a chance to upgrade a 9.2.0.7 database to 10.2.0.5. The size of the database was around 800 GB. The major applications connecting to the database were developed in Pro*C and Oracle Forms. The upgrade itself pretty smooth but there were few glitches around that needed to be handled. Just thought about documenting all the issues:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>These were few of the issues encountered, rest of the upgrade was super smooth !</p>
<p>Happy upgrading !</p>
