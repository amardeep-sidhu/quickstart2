My company uses Lotus Notes for email and Sametime connect as messenger for all the internal communication. Both are stupid applications and are a big resource hogs. Most of the systems are P IV with 512 MB RAM. You just run Lotus and Sametime 7 and it eats up everything. The system moves like a 386 based machine.

Moreover, i was looking for Lotus short cuts today and found that there is no short cut in Lotus for **Send/Receive** mail.

At our clientâ€™s site, i have seen IBM people having kept an exe killnotes.exe on their desktop which they use to quickly exit from Lotus. What bullshit ?

Outlook/Outlook Express rocks, seriously !
