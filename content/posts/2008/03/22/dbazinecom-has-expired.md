Today I was googling about Oracle Data Guard and came across an article on dbazine.com. I opened the link and it showed some stupid page. I checked again and again. Finally I noticed a message on top right:

**dbazine.com** expired on 03/13/2008 and is pending renewal or deletion.

🙁

It was a nice website.
