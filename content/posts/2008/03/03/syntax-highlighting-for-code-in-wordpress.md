I came across [a post](http://www.oraclerant.com/?p=26) about syntax highlighting for code in WordPress on [Thomas Roachâ€™s blog](http://www.oraclerant.com) who in turn saw it on [Tyler Muthâ€™s blog.](http://tylermuth.wordpress.com/) There is a plugin called [syntax highlighter](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/) which does all the beauty. Use is very simple:

Download it from [here](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/syntaxhighlighter.zip).

Upload to your blogâ€™s plugins folder and extract it over there.

Now (on WordPress) go to Plugins page and activate the plugin.

To use it wrap your code like

and you are done.

Wanna see, how does it look like ðŸ˜‰

```
<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate" title="">SQL>drop database;
```

Isnâ€™t beautiful ðŸ˜‰
