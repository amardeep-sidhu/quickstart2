I was searching for some good tutorials on <span style="font-weight: bold">awk.</span> Found a very nice (brilliant indeed) article on Oracle website by Emmett Dulaney. A very good introduction for beginners. I searched for some other links as well. Have a read:

1\. [AWK: The Linux Administratorsâ€™ Wisdom Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/dulaney_awk.html)

2\. [A Guided Tour Of Awk](http://www.vectorsite.net/tsawk_1.html)

3\. [AWK Programming](http://www.softpanorama.org/Tools/awk.shtml)

4\. [UNIX Utilities â€“ awk](http://www.uga.edu/%7Eucns/wsg/unix/awk/#ee)

Happy awkâ€™ing ðŸ™‚
