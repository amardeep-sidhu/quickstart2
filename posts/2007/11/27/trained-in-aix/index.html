<p>Last week I attended a training on AIX system administration from IBM (organized by company, obviously ðŸ˜‰ It was a 7 days course covering all of the system administration stuff. There was a lot of new stuff to learn, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LVM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> being the most number of times uttered word, once we did the chapter on LVM. It was a nice experience as a whole as for the first time I attended any training on Unix.</p>
<p>The sessions (specially after lunch) were sleepy also. I find this ppt method of training pretty boring. The trainer (most of) strictly, stupidly follows the slides and slide, I feel is a dumb sort of thing, makes you feel sleepy except at the moments when there are few eye opening bullet points.</p>
<p>There should be bare minimum number of slides and for rest of the things, trainer should use white board so that everybody follows that and doesnâ€™t sleep ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Anyways it was really enjoying to be familiar with so many things in Unix.</p>
