Today one of my friends called me to ask about<span style="font-style: italic"> ORA-01537: cannot add file ‘c:\\test1.dbf’ – file already part of database.</span> The simple reason for this could be that the datafile I am trying to add to a tablespace is already there. But no, in this case it was not like this. The tablespace was not there in DBA\_TABLESPACES but the datafile was there in DBA\_DATA\_FILES and V$DATAFILE. Also the file has been physically deleted from the disk.

So while trying to create the same tablespace with same datafile, it was giving ORA-01537.
