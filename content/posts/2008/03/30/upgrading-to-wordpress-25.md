Just finished upgrading to WordPress 2.5. Everything seems to be working fine.

Another issue I just came to know that wherever i am using [syntaxhighlighter](http://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/03/syntax-highlighting-for-code-in-wordpress/) to format the code, it doesnâ€™t display properly in Internet Explorer. May be something to do with the plugin. Will try to fix it. It works fine in Mozilla.
