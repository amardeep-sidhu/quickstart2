<main>
<p>Sometimes you may need to run GoldenGate on some different machine than the one that hosts the database. It is very much possible but some kind of restrictions apply. First is that the Endian order of both the systems should be same and the second is the bit width has to be same. For example it is not possible to run GoldenGate on a 32 bit system to read from a database that runs on some 64 bit platform. Assuming that the environemnt satisfies the above two conditions; we can use the LOGSOURCE option of TRANSLOGOPTIONS to achieve this.</p>
<p>Here we run GG on host goldengate1 (192.168.0.109) and the database from which we want to capture the changes runs on the host goldengate3 (192.168.0.111). Both the systems run 11.2.0.2 on RHEL 5.5. On goldengate3 redo logs are in the mount point /home which has been NFS mounted on goldengate1 as /home_gg3</p>

(The text in the line starting with TRANLOGOPTIONS is a single line)
</code></pre><p>So using PATHMAP we can make GG aware about the actual location of the red logs &amp; archive logs on the remote server and the mapped location on the system where GG is running (It is somewhat like db_file_name_convert option for Data Guards).</p>
<p>We fire some DMLs on the source database and then run stats command for the Extract</p>
