[Eddie Awad](http://awads.net/wp/) started a new series [<span style="font-weight: bold;">Oracle in 3 minutes</span>](http://awads.net/wp/2007/11/26/oracle-in-3-minutes-multi-versioning/) on his [blog](http://awads.net/wp/). In the first post he has discussed about multi-versioning. Its a must watch for everyone who is working on Oracle. Hoping to get more of such stuff from Eddie.
