I don‚Äôt know a bit about Apache HTTP server but faced one issue in office‚Ä¶so thought about writing it here üòâ

We are having a 3 tier setup where Oracle Application Server 10g was there on AIX 5.3. It runs Apache HTTP server and we needed to access the files outside DocumentRoot. A bit of googling revealed that we could use [Alias](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_alias.html#alias) for that. Basically we need to add the following small piece of text to httpd.conf file:

```
<pre class="brush: css; title: ; notranslate" title="">
Alias /test1/ "/home/sidhu/test1/"
<Directory "/home/sidhu/test1">
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride None
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>
```

Now we should be able to access the files in /home/sidhu/test1 by hitting the following URL

http://server:port/test1/filename.html

PS: I couldn‚Äôt find the reason but it didn‚Äôt allow me to use word ‚Äúreports‚Äù in the directory name.
