<p>Today one of my friends called me to ask about<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ORA-01537: cannot add file ‘c:\test1.dbf’ – file already part of database.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The simple reason for this could be that the datafile I am trying to add to a tablespace is already there. But no, in this case it was not like this. The tablespace was not there in DBA_TABLESPACES but the datafile was there in DBA_DATA_FILES and V$DATAFILE. Also the file has been physically deleted from the disk.</p>
<p>So while trying to create the same tablespace with same datafile, it was giving ORA-01537.</p>
