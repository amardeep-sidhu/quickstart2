Today [Stumble](http://www.stumbleupon.com/) gave me a link to [an article](http://www.maltastar.com/pages/msFullArt.asp?an=14323) on a website. That article talks about a guy [Virgil Griffith](http://virgil.gr/) who wrote a piece of software to track IP addresses of the people, editing the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_Griffith) content. Some really interesting things came up: Apple attacking Microsoft and then Microsoft taking revenge. Have a look at the full article. It makes an interesting read. Read more about this guy on Wikipedia [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_Griffith).
